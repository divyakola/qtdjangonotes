how to start the server?
------------------------
	we can start the server by using runserver command.

	python manage.py runserver

ex:
---
C:\django7am>myvenv\scripts\activate

(myvenv) C:\django7am>cd proj1

(myvenv) C:\django7am\proj1>python manage.py runserver


how to send the request to the server?
-------------------------------------
	http://127.0.0.1:8000/urlname


how to stop the server?
-----------------------
	we can stop the server through the command prompt by using ctrl+c

how to start the server on different port number?
-------------------------------------------------
	python manage.py runserver portnumber

ex:
---
(myvenv) C:\django7am\proj1>python manage.py runserver 8888

 
what is view?
-------------
	a view is a python function or class,which is used to represent the business logics.

	the view take the request from the enduser/client,to process that request and give back the response to the enduser/client.

	we can implement the views,in two ways

	1).based on functions

	2).based on classes

Function Based views?
---------------------
	we can implement the views based on functions that type of views are called Function Based views.

	whenever the enduser to send the request to the server internally our django-framework engine take that request,to verify that requet in the urls.py file.

	our requested url is verfied/valid in that case one request object is created,that request object is passing to that particular view function and executeing.

	in function based views,we can implement diffrent http request methods like GET(),POST(),PUT(),DELETE(),.... by using conditional statements.

ex1:
---
create a django project to display the "hello world" on the web browser?

step1:
-----
to create a project

	django-admin startproject projectname

(myvenv) C:\django7am>django-admin startproject proj2

step2:
-----
goto project location and to create an application in the project location.

	cd projname

	python manage.py startapp appname

(myvenv) C:\django7am>cd proj2

(myvenv) C:\django7am\proj2>python manage.py startapp app2

step3:
----
to install our application in the settings.py file of the project.

	settings.py
	-----------
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    
    'app2'
]

step4:
----
to create a views in the views.py file of the application.

	views.py
	--------
#from django.shortcuts import render
from django.http import HttpResponse
# Create your views here.
def welcome(request):
    return HttpResponse("hello world")

step5:
-----
to configure the url patterns for our views in the urls.py file of the project.

	urls.py
	-------
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path
from app2 import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('wel/',views.welcome)
]

step6:
-----
to apply the migrations

	python manage.py migrate

step7:
------
to start the server

	python manage.py runserver

step8:
-----
to send the request to the server

	http://127.0.0.1:8000/wel

structure:
----------
	proj2
	   |--->app2
	   |      |--->views.py
	   |--->proj2
	   |      |--->settings.py
	   |      |--->urls.py
	   |--->manage.py
