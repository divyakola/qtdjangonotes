		Model
		------
what is model?
--------------
	a model is a python class,which is used to representing the database related logics.

	we can define any class as a model class,our class is Extending by Model class of models module.

	class name as a model name,in database terminalogy a model represent as a one table in specified database,model name as a table name.

	we can implement the models with in the models.py file of the application.

	in our model class attributes act as a columns in our database table.

	at the time of defineing a attributes in model class,we need to specify the type of that attribute,size of that attribute and specify the constraints of that attribute.

	models module provides some attribute types,sizes and constraints.


syntax:
------
from django.db import models
class classname(models.Model):
	attr1=models.modelfieldtype(size,constraint)
	attr2=models.modelfieldtype(size,constraint)
	......
	......

example:
-------
from django.db import models
class emp(models.Model):	
	eid=models.IntegerField(primary_key=True)
	ename=models.CharField(max_length=30)
	sal=models.DecimalField(max_digits=6,decimal_place=2)


note:
----
at the time of creating a model,we dont specify any primary key attribute,by default django framework internally it will be added one primary key attribute,that is called pk/id.
